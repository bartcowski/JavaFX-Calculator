# JavaFX-Calculator

Project for PROZ (event-driven programming) course. <br />

Simple calculator application made with:
- Java
- JavaFX (graphical user interface)
- JShell (main calculations)
- SceneBuilder (easier GUI creation)
- basics of MVC design pattern.

The application is able to perform elementary arithmetic but also calculating factorials,
square roots and raising to the power of 2. It has different error/warning windows popping up
e.g. when user provides negative number for factorial operation.
